  ingredients:
    -  6 Fresh Tomatoes
    -  1 Red Onion, Diced
    -  1 Pack Pancetta Lardons
    -  2 Cloves of Garlic, Diced
    -  Fresh Basil
    -  Pepper
  method:
    - Add the tomatoes to a saucepan of boiling water. After a few minutes, the tomato skin should begin to split. At this point, remove the tomatoes from the water and allow to cool.
    - Meanwhile, brown the onion and pancetta. Add the Garlic.
    - Once the tomatoes have cooled, it should be easy to peel the skins. Add the tomato flesh to the bacon, onion and garlic.
    - Smash the tomatoes until they resemble sauce, bring to a simmer, and allow to reduce.
    - Shortly before serving, add a generous quantity of fresh basil, torn to release the flavour.
    - Add pepper to taste, serve with pasta.
